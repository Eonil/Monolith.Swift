The core of parser is iteration over elements by rules.
Iteration is categorised into two rules; sequence and choice.
Sequence requires matching of all elements.
Choice reqyures matching of any element.

Any other rules can be derived from combination of sequence 
and choice rules, so they can be extended later once the core
rules are correctly implemented.
